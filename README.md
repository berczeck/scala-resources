> A curated list of Scala, Akka, Play, Spray and Akka-Http resources.

**[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)** began life in 2003, created by Martin Odersky and his research group at EPFL, next to Lake Geneva and the Alps, in Lausanne, Switzerland. Scala has since grown into a mature open source programming language, used by hundreds of thousands of developers, and is developed and maintained by scores of people all over the world.

**[Akka](http://akka.io/)** is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM.

**[Play](https://www.playframework.com/)** is an open source web application framework which follows the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

**[Spray](http://spray.io/)** is an open-source toolkit for building REST/HTTP-based integration layers on top of Scala and Akka. Being asynchronous, actor-based, fast, lightweight, modular and testable it's a great way to connect your Scala applications to the world.

**[Akka-Http](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala.html)** it’s not a web-framework but rather a more general toolkit for providing and consuming HTTP-based services. While interaction with a browser is of course also in scope it is not the primary focus of Akka HTTP.

## Training Courses

- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1) - In this course you will discover the elements of the functional programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily programming tasks.
- [Functional Program Design in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2) - In this course you will learn how to apply the functional programming style in the design of larger applications.
- [Parallel programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1) -  In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism. In particular, you'll see how many familiar ideas from functional programming map perfectly to to the data parallel paradigm.
- [Introduction to scala](https://bigdatauniversity.com/courses/introduction-to-scala/) - Learn the foundations of the language for developers and data scientists interested in using Scala for data analysis.
- [Learn By Example: Scala](https://www.udemy.com/learn-by-example-scala/)
- [Beginning Scala Programming](https://www.udemy.com/beginning-scala-programming/)
- [Learn To Build Scala Apps From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-build-scala-apps-from-scratch/) 
- [Scala for Java Developers](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/scala-for-java-developers/table-of-contents) - This course is for Java developers looking to transition to programming in Scala. Translate what you already know in Java to Scala and start your functional programming journey.
- [Scala: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/scala-getting-started/table-of-contents) - This course will teach enough of the basics of Scala to enable you to start writing less boiler-plate code and more business code.
