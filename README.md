# Scala resources [![Scala resources](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of Scala, Akka, Play, Spray and Akka-Http resources.

**[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)** began life in 2003, created by Martin Odersky and his research group at EPFL, next to Lake Geneva and the Alps, in Lausanne, Switzerland. Scala has since grown into a mature open source programming language, used by hundreds of thousands of developers, and is developed and maintained by scores of people all over the world.
**[Akka](http://akka.io/)** is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM.
**[Play](https://www.playframework.com/)** is based on a lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture.
**[Spray](http://spray.io/)** is an open-source toolkit for building REST/HTTP-based integration layers on top of Scala and Akka. Being asynchronous, actor-based, fast, lightweight, modular and testable it's a great way to connect your Scala applications to the world.
**[Akka-Http](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala.html)** it’s not a web-framework but rather a more general toolkit for providing and consuming HTTP-based services. While interaction with a browser is of course also in scope it is not the primary focus of Akka HTTP.
